    "In this chapter, we’ll explore **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**, where the main principle is to **“think first, answer later.”** This approach encourages Solar to break down problems logically and solve them step by step, rather than jumping directly to a conclusion. CoT is especially effective for multi-step math problems and complex reasoning tasks, as it guides the model to consider each part of the problem individually, ultimately building up to a coherent solution."
