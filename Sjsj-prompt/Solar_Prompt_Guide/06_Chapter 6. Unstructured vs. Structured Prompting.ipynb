    "The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of the decisions you make when building systems in the cloud. The six pillars of the Framework allow you to learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems. Using the AWS Well-Architected Tool, available at no charge in the AWS Management Console, you can review your workloads against these best practices by answering a set of questions for each pillar.\n",
    "For more expert guidance and best practices for your cloud architecture—reference architecture deployments, diagrams, and whitepapers—refer to the AWS Architecture Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "AWS makes it easy to deploy your workloads in AWS by creating resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, security groups, and AWS Lambda functions. You can also scale and grow the ﬂeet of AWS resources that hosts your applications, stores your data, and expands your AWS infrastructure over time. As your AWS usage grows to many resource types spanning multiple applications, you will need a mechanism to track which resources are assigned to which application. Use this mechanism to support your operational activities, such as cost monitoring, incident management, patching, backup, and access control.\n",
    "In on-premises environments, this knowledge is often captured in knowledge management systems, document management systems, and on internal wiki pages. With a configuration management database (CMDB), you can store and manage the relevant detailed metadata using standard change control processes. This approach provides governance, but requires additional effort to develop and maintain. You can take a structured approach to the naming of resources, but a resource name can only hold a limited amount of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first tagging use cases organizations often tackle is visibility and management of cost and usage. There are usually a few reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's typically a well understood scenario and requirements are well known. For example, finance teams want to see the total cost of workloads and infrastructure that span across multiple services, features, accounts, or teams. One way to achieve this cost visibility is through consistent tagging of resources.\n",
    "2. Tags and their values are clearly defined. Usually, cost allocation mechanisms already exist in an organization’s finance systems, for example, tracking by cost center, business unit, team, or organization function\n",
    "3. Rapid, demonstrable return on investment. It’s possible to track cost optimization trends over time when resources are tagged consistently, for example, for resources that were rightsized, auto-scaled, or put on a schedule.\n",
    "Understanding how you incur costs in AWS allows you to make informed financial decisions. Knowing where you have incurred costs at the resource, workload, team, or organization level enhances your understanding of the value delivered at the applicable level when compared to the business outcomes achieved.\n",
    "The engineering teams might not have experience with financial management of their resources. Attaching a person with a specialized skill in AWS financial management who can train engineering and development teams on the basics of AWS financial management and create a relationship between finance and engineering to foster the culture of FinOps will help achieve measurable outcomes for the business and encourage teams to build with cost in mind. Establishing good financial practices is covered in depth by the Cost Optimization Pillar of the Well-Architected Framework, but we will touch on a few of the fundamental principles in this whitepaper.\n",
    "AWS resources can be tagged for a variety of purposes, from implementing a cost allocation strategy to supporting automation or authorizing access to AWS resources. Implementing a tagging strategy can be challenging for some organizations, owing to the number of stakeholder groups involved and considerations such as data sourcing and tag governance.\n",
    "In this whitepaper, we’ve outlined recommendations regarding designing and implementing a tagging strategy in an organization based on operational practices, defined use cases, stakeholders involved in the process, and tools and services provided by AWS. When it comes to a tagging strategy, it’s a process of iteration and improvement, where you start small from your immediate priority, identify relevant use cases across your organization, and then implement and grow the tagging schema as you need to, while continuously measuring and improving effectiveness. We’ve pointed out that a well-defined set of tags within your organization will allow you to relate AWS usage and consumption to teams responsible for the resources and business purpose for which they exist, in order to align with organizational strategy and value.\"\"\""

    "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\n",
    "The Constitution’s federalist structure allows each state to maintain its own government.1 This structure creates a risk that multiple states will exercise their powers over the same issue or dispute, leading to confusion and uncertainty.2 The Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause mitigates that risk by adjusting the states’ interrelationships.3 The Clause requires each state to give “Full Faith and Credit” to “the public Acts” of “every other State,” such as other states’ statutes.4 The Clause also requires states to give “Full Faith and Credit” to the “Records[ ] and judicial Proceedings of every other State.” 5\n",
    "The Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Clause has shifted over time.6 The Court has settled on a doctrinal framework that treats out-of-state court judgments differently from out-of-state laws.7 Whereas the modern Court generally requires states to give out-of-state judgments conclusive effect, states have more freedom to apply their own laws in their own courts, so long as they do not close their courts completely to claims based on other states’ laws.8\n",
    "The Clause also authorizes Congress to enact “general Laws” that “prescribe the Manner in which [states'] Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.” 9 Congress has invoked this authority several times, such as to require federal and territorial courts to apply the same full faith and credit principles as state courts.10 However, the Supreme Court has not yet considered where the outer boundaries of that power lie.11\n",
    "Litigants frequently ask state judges to enforce judgments entered by other states’ courts, such as judgments for monetary damages.12 Those judges must decide whether to honor that judgment—and, if so, what legal effect the judgment will have. In addition, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires states to recognize other states’ “public Acts,” such as statutes.13 This language has raised questions regarding how state courts must treat other states’ laws. Besides the question of which state’s laws a court must apply when two statutes conflict, the Court has also considered whether a state court must entertain causes of action based on other states’ laws. The Court has interpreted the Clause to require states to open their courts to claims based on other states’ laws under various circumstances.14\n",
    "Whereas the Full Faith and Credit Clause’s first sentence mandates that “Full Faith and Credit . . . be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State,” its second sentence authorizes Congress to “prescribe . . . the Effect” of “such Acts, Records, and Proceedings.” 15 The relationship between these two sentences raises interpretive questions. Because the first sentence already requires states to give out-of-state acts and proceedings full faith and credit, the Framers’ reasons for authorizing Congress to specify the effect of those acts and proceedings are unclear.16 Nor is it clear whether the Clause’s second sentence empowers Congress to enact legislation allowing states to refuse to give effect to particular categories of acts, records, and proceedings.17 Congress has seldom invoked its legislative authority under the Clause and thus has rarely tested that power’s potential limits.18 As a result, the scope of Congress’s powers under the Clause remains unsettled.19\"\"\""
