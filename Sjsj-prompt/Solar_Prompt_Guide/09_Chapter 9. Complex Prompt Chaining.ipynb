    "Prompt chaining is a technique in prompt engineering where multiple prompts are linked together to guide the model through a series of logical steps or stages to complete a complex task. This technique is particularly **useful for breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.** The output of one prompt serves as the input for the next, creating a chain that leads to the final answer."

      "The text discusses the impact of institutional settings on question-answer sequences, highlighting that participants' conduct and language are influenced by the norms and constraints of the situation. The text cites Heritage's (2002b) research on institutional interactions and Clayman and Heritage's (2002b) study on televised news interviews with political figures. The findings reveal that in formal settings, there are prescribed procedures and expectations that influence linguistic behavior. For example, interviewers in televised news interviews often embed implicit assumptions or agendas within their questions, such as using negative interrogatives to imply a certain judgement. The text emphasizes that the formulation of questions and responses in institutional settings is significantly influenced by the specific communicative demands of the situation, leading to distinct linguistic patterns and strategies employed by participants.\n",
